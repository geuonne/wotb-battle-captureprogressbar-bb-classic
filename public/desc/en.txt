This mod gives a capture progress bar from WoT PC v0.7.4 (the patch when Encounter battles were introduced). Additionaly:
- The capture progress value is always shown (e.g. in Supremacy, or in Encounter when there are players from different teams on the base)
- Only one file modified: no HUDLayer.yaml modifications needed (can be useful for mod packs)

Notes:
Q: Can you add capture timer/tank in capture number?
A: For this the game decompilation and research on how these things work, and probably modifying the code, is needed.

Q: The light bulb is displayed over the capture progress bar.
A: I don't see a critical issue here.

Compatibility:
- Platform: any
